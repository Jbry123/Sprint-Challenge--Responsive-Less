1. a preprocessor takes a more simple code and compiles it into css, the language of all websites.

4. FIXED LAYOUTS are usually designed at 900-1100 pixels, they do not change from screen to screen.

FLUID LAYOUTS, AKA RESPONSIVE LAYOUTS are constantly changing due to being designed in percentages.
